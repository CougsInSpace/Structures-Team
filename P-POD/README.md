Project Title:
P-Pod (Poly Picosatellite) Orbital Deployer Replica

Project Lead: TBA (Was Regan Mills) 

Description:
The Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD) is a standard deployment system that ensures
all CubeSat developers conform to common physical requirements. The P-POD plays a critical
role as the interface between the launch vehicle and CubeSats. The P-POD utilizes a tubular
design and can hold up to 340.5mm x 100mm x 100mm of deployable hardware.

Current Progress:
1 assembly
- P-Pod Assembly
4 parts (incomplete)
- P-Pod Housing, main body of the deployer
- P-Pod Cap, end cap of p-pod
- P-Pod Door, other door or "cap" that is unlatched and opened
- P-Pod Latch, latch that opens the door

To-Do:
- Locate adequate spring for use in P-Pod and interface with "P-Pod Cap"
- Determine a resonable material to use and redesign housing to meet strength requirements based on spring load.
- Add threaded rod through housing and bolt on either side to secure "cap"
- FEA on all parts to find weak points
- Added parts as needed
